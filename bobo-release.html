<h1>Bobo: kiss static site generator</h1>
<h6>Mon  4 May 19:50:39 BST 2020</h6>
<p>Just released first version of bobo, the static site generator with which
this website is done.</p>
<p>The name "bobo" is a parody of the famous hugo where "bobo" means "fool" in
Spanish.</p>
<p>I was a bit confused by the fact that even the most simple static site
generator was at about 500 lines of code. The core of <code>bobo</code> that actually
builds the site (<code>bobo-build</code> and <code>bobo-build-page</code>) is ~ 70 lines of code. Then
the other two commands, <code>bobo-init</code> and <code>bobo-run</code> are two utilities that
initialise the directory and run a busybox httpd server for convenience (but are
not necessary at all).</p>
<p><code>bobo</code> lets you generate a template and then creates pages with the additional
capability to edit blog posts (this whole site, including the blog posts, is
generated with it).</p>
<p>You can find the source code
<a href="https://github.com/cristianrz/bobo.git">on my git repos</a>.
